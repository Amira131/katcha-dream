                    That is the essence of manifesting and the basis of The Law of Attraction, which states that whatever you focus on, you attract into your reality.

                    There are many ways to use the Law of Attraction for manifesting your desires, but one popular new way is with the 369 Manifestation Method.
       
                <br></br>
                <br></br>  
                


                    The 369 method is a fascinating combination of Law of Attraction, Abraham Hicks, and Nikola Tesla theories.

                    Many people claim this method has helped them manifest money, love, and fame. The inventor, Karin Yee, first shared the method on Tic Toc in 2020. She used it to manifest $10,165.46!

                <h2>What is the 369 manifestation method?</h2>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    369 Manifestation method technique is a Law of Attraction technique where you journal or jot down what you would like to manifest 3 times in the morning, 6 times in midday, and 9 times before bed.
                    You write down each desire as an affirmation and hold the affirmation in your thoughts for 17 seconds. And continue this practice for 45 days.
                
                <br></br>
            

                </p>
                <br></br>
            

                <p>
                    The idea is that by writing down your desires each day using this method, your focus becomes crystal clear. <br></br>
                    You train your brain to experience your desired thoughts as if they were real. Which supercharges your ability to manifest those desires into your reality. Using the 369 method for 45 days allows you time to align your energy.
                </p>
                <br></br>
            

                <p>
                    The 369 manifestation method is a unique way to use The Law of Attraction (LOA). This is because it combines the LOA with the 369 number work of Nikola Tesla and the 17-second rule channeled by Abraham-Hicks.
                
                <br></br>

                </p>
                <br></br>

                <h1> Cool, right? Let’s discuss how it all works.</h1>
                <br></br>

                <h2> How are the numbers 369 significant?</h2>
                <br></br>

                <p>

                    Nikola Tesla believed 3,6, and 9 to be divine numbers. He is known for having said, “If you only knew the magnificence of the numbers 3, 6, and 9, then you have the key to the universe.” <br></br> Tesla was fascinated by the mathematic characteristics of these 3 numbers.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    For instance, by doubling 1, you get 2. And then as you keep doubling numbers, 3,6, and 9 are excluded. <br></br> This gives the numbers 3, 6, and 9 a special frequency in nature. 
                    <br></br>
                    
                    Noted that a circle, which is a symbol of infinity, has a composition that when reduced to its digital root, has the results 3 + 6 + 0 = 9.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Tesla performed his daily living activities using these numbers. He did things like walk around the block 3 times before entering a building. And he would only stay in hotel rooms divisible by the number 3.
                </p>
                <br></br>

                <h2>What is the 17-second rule of Abraham Hicks?</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    The 17-second rule came from Esther Hicks, a famous Law of Attraction author, speaker, and spirit channeler. <br></br>
                    She is the author of the best-selling book, Ask and It Is Given.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    The 17-second rule states that when you focus on a thought for 17 seconds, you create a “combustion point” of thought energy.<br></br> Those 17 seconds fire up the vibration for the thought to manifest. This can be a difficult task to achieve because naturally, we all have many interrupting thoughts. <br></br>As anyone who has tried meditating will know, holding a thought in its pure state for 17 seconds can take some practice.
                </p>

                <h2>How to manifest using the 369 method</h2>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <h1>Step 1- Set your intention</h1>
                <br></br>
                
                <h4> For the first step, get crystal clear on what exactly you are manifesting.</h4>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Imagine and feel the feeling of having your desire be your reality.<br></br> Say out loud or in your mind exactly what you desire while holding that feeling. <br></br>This proclaims your intention clearly to The Universe.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h1>Step 2- Journal 3 times in the morning</h1>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Pull out your journal or worksheet and write down what you desire three times. Write your desire as an affirmation.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Examples:</h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    I’m so happy and fulfilled in this new relationship. It feels so good to have this extra money.
                <br></br>
                    My career makes me happy and fulfilled.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    As you write each affirmation, hold the affirmation thought for 17 seconds. Importantly, feel the joyous feeling of manifesting your desire as you hold that thought for 17 seconds. <br></br> Allow your spirit to completely submerge in the excitement, anticipation, and joy of having what you desire. Step 3- Journal 6 times at midday
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h1>Step 3 -  Journal six times around midday</h1>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    As you write, deeply feel how it is to have your desired reality. Smell, touch, taste, and sense on every level how it is to experience your desired reality. For each affirmation, hold the thought and feeling for 17 seconds.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Again, holding a thought and feeling for 17 seconds may take some practice. It’s natural to have plenty of interrupting thoughts. And contradictory thoughts. We will discuss those in just a minute.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h1>Step 4- Journal 9 times before bed</h1>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    At the end of your day before bed, journal your desire nine more times. Again, focus your mindset to experience how the reality of having your desires feels. <br></br>Hold each affirmative intention statement for 17 seconds in your mind and heart. Allow yourself to be filled with all the good feelings and sensations that come with your manifestation becoming your reality.
                </p>

                <h1>Tips for the 369 method</h1>
                <br></br>
                <h2>Practice</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Because holding any thought for 17 seconds is difficult, practice is necessary. So just keep at it. The main reason it is suggested to do the 369 method for 45 days is to practice getting better at holding your intention and maintaining energetic alignment.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3> Ignore contrary thoughts</h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    As you practice holding your intention each time you write it, you will encounter many contrary thoughts. Thoughts like:
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    This isn’t working.
                    This is a waste of time.
                    But I can’t manifest that because…
                    Ignore those thoughts.
                    <br></br> They are just thoughts blocking your path and nothing more. They are no more true than encouraging thoughts. <br></br> Give them no power by simply refocusing on the feeling of having that which you desire.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Do not obsess</h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    After completing the manifestation technique each day, forget about it. Let it go. Find something else to do and let the “behind the scenes activity” of The Universe get to work. <br></br>If your energetic vibration is needy, desperate, rushed, or wanting in any way, your results will be affected. Every bit of your energy is 100% connected.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    A thing you can do is make a plan about what to do directly after your manifestation exercises. For example, have a book ready to read, make a phone call, or sing a song loudly while cleaning the house.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Be light-hearted about it</h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Your desires are strong. But you have to take them lightly. It’s a paradox. And something that is difficult to put into words.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    You love what you desire and feel it powerfully. The feeling of having your intention is intense. But in a way, you have to not care about them at all. <br></br>You have to detach your emotional strings to allow The Universe to present you with your desire.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>A tip for holding your intention lightly</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    Imagine your desire like a coin. On heads, you love your desire and feel such powerful joyful energy about having it. It has weight to it, and you feel the texture in your hand. Now flip the coin over.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    On its other side, the coin is light as a feather. It looks like a hologram, lightly hovering in your hand. You realize that it barely exists. 
                    <br></br>Your emotions regarding your desires become like a drop of watercolor paint in a bathtub. Every emotion about your intention fades but an aura of light and love remains. And you carry on with your day.
